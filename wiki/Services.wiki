#summary Protocol-Buffer Service C Mapping

= Introduction =

Protocol-Buffers defines a mapping for a Service, which boils down to list of methods, each having:
  * a name
  * an input message type
  * an output message type

The C binding protobuf-c defines a C structure, ProtobufCService, which is the basis for both
  * services generated by protoc-c (the protobuf C code generator)
  * services implemented by RPC systems (protobuf-c-rpc is an example)

When using the code generator, the service is "derived" from ProtobufCService like this:
 
{{{ 
 typedef struct _Foo__DirLookup_Service Foo__DirLookup_Service;
 struct _Foo__DirLookup_Service
 {
  ProtobufCService base;
  void (*by_name)(Foo__DirLookup_Service *service,
                  const Foo__Name *input,
                  Foo__LookupResult_Closure closure,
                  void *closure_data);
 };
}}}
We provide two macros:
   * `FOO__DIR_LOOKUP__BASE_INIT` which defines merely the functions for `base`
   * `FOO__DIR_LOOKUP__INIT(function_prefix__)` which assumes that all the methods required by this service are `function_prefix__` followed by the method name.
