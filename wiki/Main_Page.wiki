#summary protobuf-c wiki home page

= Introduction =

protobuf-c is a C binding for Google's [http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ Protocol Buffers] (aka protobuf) library and code generator.

The overall [Design design] is similar to the C++ structure,
except we try to generate as little code as possible.

= Compilation and Installation =
This is an automake project, so to build it use something like:
{{{
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/install
   make
   make install
}}}
To install into `/usr` like a normal package would, use `--prefix=/usr`.

= Getting Started =
To use the system, you should read more
about [Generated_Code the code we generate].
To understand how the generated code works,
read about [libprotobuf_c].

= Status =
  * The message serialization and deserialization code has been thoroughly tested.
  * Still designing the Service stuff, so be careful about using it.
  * Need to decide what to do about extensionn
  * Need to decide whether to handle groups.

= Caveats =

Some binary compatibility changes are expected until version 1.0 is released; so make sure you are linking to the protobuf-c that corresponds to the generated code you are using!

= TODO items =
Currently, these are in a file called `TODO` in the source package.
