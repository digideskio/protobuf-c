= Introduction =

protobuf-c is a C binding for Google's Protocol Buffers (aka protobuf) library and code generator.

The overall [Design design] is similar to the C++ structure,
except we try to generate as little code as possible.

To use the system, you should read more
about [Generated_Code the code we generate].
To understand how the generated code works,
read about [libprotobuf_c].
